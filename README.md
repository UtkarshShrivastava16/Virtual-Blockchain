# Virtual-Blockchain

The following is a virtual blockchain project, based on proof of work consensus. This project is divided into two segments:-
<br>
1. Thread-Based Nodes: <br>Here multithreading is used to create a race between the nodes to mine the given block. The first thread to mine earns the reward.
<br><br>
2. Instance-Based Nodes:<br> Here each node's instance has to be run on a different console, and a connection is to be established between them for the blockchain mining system to function.
